## PULLING NEW CHANGES

when pulling new changes after already having cloned, you should thoroughly review the version changes in both the commit history, and `/system/changes.json` to ensure that your existing code is compatible with the latest version of the msn2 library. commits are made often, and this only emphasizes the importance of reviewing the changes made to the language.

### steps after cloning

1. navigate to the cloned repository:

```sh
cd msnscript2
```

2. install dependencies in `requirements.txt`, this can be done through pip or globally with:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py install
```

3. launch the msn2 help pages with:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py help
```

4. navigate to the _settings_ page

5. set your python _runner_alias_ (for most this is set to 'python'). specifying this is important for calls such as proc() or JAVA().

6. ensure your alias has been set correctly, and the integrity of the msn2 library is intact with:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py verify
```

7. install the [msn2-syntax-highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MasonMarker.msn2-syntax-highlighting) VS Code extension (or use the _CoffeeScript_ language mode if this isn't available to you)

8. learn to code in msn2 by reading through and running `TUTORIAL/suggestedusage2.msn2` as well as files in `demos/`, `problems/`, and `projects/`

### starting a .msn2 script (latest version, recommended)

create a file with a `.msn2` extension in the `msnscript2/` directory to get started ðŸš€

there are a few ways to launch an msn2 program, but the recommended way uses the msn2 CLI:

```sh
cd msnscript2
```

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py -f script1
```

you should be in the `msnscript2/` directory when launching programs or interacting with the msn2 CLI.

the `.msn2` file extension is optional when specifying a file to execute.

#### CLI examples

multiple files:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py -f script1 -f script2
```

<!--
##### multiple files with system arguments

- `{python_alias} msn2cli.py time -f script1 -a "['hello', 'bye']" -f script2 -a "'no way'"` -->

multiple files with system arguments:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py time -f script1 -a "['hello', 'bye']" -f script2 -a "'no way'"
```

running just a code snippet:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py -s "(@v = 1, print(v))"
```

timing .msn2 code:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py time -s "sleep(1)"
```

run `{python_alias} msn2cli.py --help` for more information on the msn2cli interpreter and its usage.

### tutorial

See the msn2 suggested usage and tutorials in the `TUTORIAL/` directory for more information on how to use the msn2 language.

The help pages also offer a walkthrough of the suggested usage, invoke the help pages with:

```sh
{python_alias} msn2cli.py help
```

### known issues

find language integrity related issues under the [issues](https://github.com/masonmarker/msnscript2/issues) tab of this repository.

### notes

- see `demos/` for demonstrations
- see `tests/` for syntax specific usage (find the most recent validator in /tests)
- see `projects/` for larger demonstrations
- see `portable/` for a portable MSNScript2 Interpreter package that can be copied
  into your project directories for launching .msn2 programs anywhere.
- see `problems/` for popular programming problems solved in msn2.
- see `system/` for system related operations in msn2.

- run `{python_alias} msn2cli.py verify` to run the validator for msn2 integrity.

again, run '{python_alias} msn2.py help' for more information on the msn2 interpreter and its usage, or see more help through the CLI with `{python_alias} msn2cli.py --help`
